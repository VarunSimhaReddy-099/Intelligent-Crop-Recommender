# Intelligent-Crop-Recommender
The decision of a farmer on which crop to cultivate is typically influenced by his intuition and other irrelevant variables, such as the desire to make quick money, ignorance of market demand, exaggeration of a soil's ability to support a particular crop, and so forth. The farmer's family's financial situation could be severely strained by a very bad decision that he made. Maybe this is one of the numerous factors contributing to the multiple farmer suicide cases that the media reports on every day. Such a wrong decision would have detrimental effects on not just the farmer's family but also the entire economy of an area in a country like India, where agriculture and associated sectors account to about 20.4% of its Gross Value Added. Because of this, we have determined that a farmer's decision on which crop to cultivate during a specific season is a very serious one. The urgent requirement is to create a system that might offer Indian farmers predictive information so they could choose which crop to produce with knowledge. In view of this, we suggest an intelligence system, that would evaluate soil characteristics such as (pH value, soil type, and nutrient concentration) as well as environmental factors such as (temperature, rainfall, and humidity) before advising the user on the most suited crop.
